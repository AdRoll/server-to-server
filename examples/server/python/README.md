Python Server Side Example Code
===============================
Example code for calling the NextRoll API using Python on your server.

These examples assume you are using Flask as a web framework but can be
easily modified to support a different framework (e.g. Pylons, Django, etc).


api.js
------
Object oriented service for bundling and transmitting event data to the
NextRoll API. All of the example snippets make use of this service.

When using these examples, make sure to replace the "REPLACE_ME" values
with those assigned to your account.


cart.js
-------
Example snippet to use for logging "add to cart" events.

conv.js
-------
Example snippet to use for logging "conversion" events.

prd.js
------
Example snippet to use for logging "product search" events.

pv.js
-----
Example snippet to use for logging "page view" events.

This event should be used on every page view, regardless of what other actions
occur.
